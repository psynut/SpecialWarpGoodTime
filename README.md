# Game Design Document

## Title: Special Warp Good Time (Working Title)

### Overview

_What is the game about? Who are the characters? Who are the enemies? What are the challenges or puzzles of the game? What weapons or tools are in the game? What’s the environment?_

### Marketing

#### Public Targets

While the game is intended to be appropriate for any and all players, the most prime target are those who will also be joining the game jam, as they are the same people who will be reviewing the game.

#### Deadlines

GameOff 2024's submission deadline is Sunday, Dec 1 at 1:37pm (PST). It will be helpful to have the Itch.io page ready to receive the game by Friday, Nov 29 with a known flow for publishing the game to HTML5. I will set my own personal deadline to Sunday, Dec 1 at 9am (PST).

#### Competitors

Other submissions to Gameoff 2024.

#### Selling Points

**N/A or TBD**

### High Concept

A 2D platformer with some breaking of the 4th wall.

### Gameplay

_How to control the objects in the game and how to make them interact with the other parts. How will the player execute the possible moves? How does the game flow?_

#### First Minutes

_What will the player see when it just finished  loading? Is there a hook? What’s the initial progress in the game?_

#### Gameflow

_All the options the player will have. General flow screens (e.g. from the “Main menu” screen it goes to the “select level” screen) and/or how the game may change depending on the player’s choices._

#### Victory Conditions

_What are the goals?_

#### Number of Players

One

### Art

_What will the game look? What kind of art is behind it? What feelings are being evoked?_

### Technical Aspects

Primarily to be played on browser play, but it would be helpful to also have an executable version for desktop as well (to be playable on the itch.io app). The game will be built on Godot - while having a product at the end of this process is a priority (a game that works is the lowest bar) another priority and even greater importance is building familiarity and comfort with building on Godot.
